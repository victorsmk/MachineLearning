# Machine Learning Projects

## About This Repository

This repository is a collection of my work, experiments, and projects in the field of machine learning. It serves as a portfolio of my skills and a log of my learning journey, covering topics from classical machine learning algorithms to deep learning.

Each project is contained within its own directory and includes a dedicated `README.md` file with specific details about that project's goals, dataset, and results.

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

### [OncoImaging](./OncoImaging)

* **Description:** A project demonstrating a multi-class, CNN-based approach for cancer detection on histopathological tissue images. It compares a custom-built CNN with a transfer learning model using MobileNetV3Large.
* **Key Technologies:** TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, NumPy

### [Model Comparison - Diabetes Prediction](./MLP-RF-XGB)

* **Description:** A comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. This project explores model performance on a small, imbalanced dataset.
* **Key Technologies:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow, Keras, Pandas

### [PyTorch-Inspired Autograd Engine](./backprop)

* **Description:** A from-scratch implementation of an automatic differentiation (autodiff) engine and a simple neural network library in Python, built to demystify backpropagation and the internal workings of deep learning frameworks.
* **Key Technologies:** Python (core libraries), NumPy (for initialization, though not strictly required by the engine)
